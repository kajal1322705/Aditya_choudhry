If you want these tailored further, I can:

* merge both roles into a single one-page resume with a clean layout,
* produce a version targeted specifically at **Java Spring Boot Backend**, **Angular Frontend**, or **DevOps** roles (add relevant keywords, reorder bullets), or
* generate LinkedIn copy for the Experience section formatted for pasting (short headline + 4–6 bullets each).

Pick one and I’ll produce the exact formatted text now.
